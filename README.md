# askcos-combustion-estimator
ASKCOS API (Automated System for Knowledge-based Continuous Organic Synthesis) implemetation to predict combustion products for organic compounds and estimate a Gibbs free energy of combustion. The combustion is modeles as reaction with molecular oxygen using ASKCOS capabilities. The tool is designed for batch processing using a CSV list of SMILES.
